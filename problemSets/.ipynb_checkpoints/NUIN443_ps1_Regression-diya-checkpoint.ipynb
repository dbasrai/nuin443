    "This is choice data from the accumulating-towers task (Pinto*, Koay* et al, 2018, Front Behav Neurosci). Please refer to the paper if you're curious about the details. <br>\n",
    "What you need to know for this problem is that mice navigate a virtual T maze, and experience pulsed visual stimuli (towers), which occur randomly (following Poisson statistics) on the right (R) and left (L) sides of the maze. This means that, on different trials, there are different number of R and L towers. The mice get rewarded for turning into the side arm corresponding to the side where they saw the most towers. Indeed, we see that their performance is clearly modulated by the amount of sensory evidence, which we will parametrize as \\\\( \\Delta_{towers} = num. R \\ – \\ num. L\\\\). The thing that makes this problem fun, though, is that the ideal strategy is to just pay attention to the towers (since reward is deterministic), but mice often go through bouts of non-stimulus-driven startegies, like exploration (\"let me check out the other arm just in case\"), perseveration (\"whatever, I'm just picking left no matter what\"), reward-based strategies (win-stay, win-shift). What's in common about these non-stimulus-driven strategies is that they all depend on the history of previous rewards and behavioral choices. We will use regression to estimate the relative impact of those strategies. <br>\n",
